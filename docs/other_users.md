### Step 1: Getting the source

Click on code and download zip. Extract the archive and rename the folder from ```Portfolio-main``` to ```portfolio```.

### Step 2: Run a webserver

Open the terminal

Navigate to the portfolio folder you just created and run this command: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

If you have python 3 installed you can run the webserver with the following command: ```python3 -m http.server```

### Step 3: Happy Coding :)

Now you have a working copy of my portfolio at http://localhost:8000.
